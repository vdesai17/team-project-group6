# Team Contract

**Your team is free to revise this contract as your team wishes; we have scaffolded it with a recommended structure similar to the provided sample on Quercus.**

After you reflect on past teamwork experiences and brainstorm a list of actions required for a positive teamwork experience, answer these questions. 

Once you have all agreed on the contents of the team contract, make a PR to merge your team contract into the main branch of your team's repo on GitHub.

**Please remember to remove any of the initial instruction text when your team finalizes your team contract; it should resemble the provided sample once complete, but with details specific to the expectations and norms agreed to by your entire team.**

## Purpose of this Contract

This contract sets out shared expectations and commitments for how our team will collaborate during the course. It is designed to promote accountability, professionalism, and mutual support as we complete individual preparation, readiness assurance tests, in-class activities, and our course project.

---
## Team Norms and Expectations

### Communication

* Which platform will you use for communication outside of class, when required for work on your course project? (Examples: Text message, Discord, WeChat, etc.)
We will be using Discord as the primary form of communication, which includes any calls, messages to each member.

* Each teammate agrees to respond to messages in at most how long? 1 day? 2 days? Some other amount of time? 
We will keep it flexible to 1 or 2 days, however if it is urgent we are allowed to call one another or gather group for a call.

* What things should a teammate notify you about? (Examples: if they think they won't be able to meet a deadline, if they have to miss lecture, etc.)
They should notify us about any issues regarding deadlines, missing a lecture/lab, and any issues with the code that needs fixing.

* Respectful and inclusive behaviour are necessary for smooth and productive communication. What are some respectful and inclusive behaviours you expect when communicating with each other during lectures, labs, or outside of class? (Examples: Actively listening to each team members ideas, giving everyone a chance to meaningfully contribute, etc.)
We all believe that having open communication and an open mind is important, as we allow input from everyone on the team and their ideas. Additionally, we should respect each other's time.

### [Other Categories of norms and expectations go here]

* Based on your previous teamwork experiences, what other behaviours do you agree upon as a team?
    - some examples of possible additional team norms and expectations are included in the sample team contract in case your team needs some help getting ideas for what else you want to include.
Some additional team norms consist of being open and communicate ideas or issues, being academically honest about code being used as in the past it has caused issues.
---

## Decision Making

* How will decisions about your team project be made? (Examples: By majority vote, by unanimous vote, etc.)
Decisions will be made by majority vote, as it makes it easier for everyone to agree or disagree. However, if someone disagrees we will
always take into consideration their reasons and, re asses the decision.

---
## Conflict resolution

* How will your team resolve conflicts? (Example: by listening to each other's side of the issue and attempting to reach a compromise. By consulting a TA or instructor as a team, if a resolution has not yet been reached.)
To resolve any conflicts we will first hear each other out, and consider different opinions. Once we have heard everyone out we could settle for a compromise, or
run a vote to see how we can resolve it. And finally, if the conflict still carries on we can consult a TA or professor.

---

## Accountability

* Reliability and accountability are also important aspects of teamwork. What are the responsibilities of each team member? (Example: completing their share of the work in a timely manner, seeking assistance from teammates/TAs/instructors when required, etc.)
Each team member will be responsible for their assigned task, and should be accountable for any missed tasks/internal deadline we can allow a
2-3 hour grace period to do it, and team members can always ask for help.
