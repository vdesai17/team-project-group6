## Purpose of this Contract

This contract sets out shared expectations and commitments for how our team will collaborate during the course. It is designed to promote accountability, professionalism, and mutual support as we complete individual preparation, readiness assurance tests, in-class activities, and our course project.

## Team Norms and Expectations

### Communication

* We will be using Discord as the primary form of communication, which includes any calls, messages to each member. As well as instagram for any urgent messages.

* Teamates should reply to messages (for flexibility) within 1 or 2 days, however if it is urgent we are allowed to call one another or gather group for a call.

* Teamates should notify the team about any issues regarding deadlines, missing a lecture/lab, and any issues with the code that needs fixing.

* We all believe that having open communication and an open mind is important, as we allow input from everyone on the team and their ideas. Additionally, we should respect each other's time, and consistent and equal contributions to the project.

### [Other Categories of norms and expectations go here]

* Some additional team norms consist of being open and communicate ideas or issues, being academically honest about code being used as in the past it has caused issues.
---

## Decision Making

* Decisions will be made by majority vote, as it makes it easier for everyone to agree or disagree. However, if someone disagrees we will always take into consideration their reasons and, re asses the decision.

---
## Conflict resolution

* To resolve any conflicts we will first hear each other out, and consider different opinions. Once we have heard everyone out we could settle for a compromise, or run a vote to see how we can resolve it. And finally, if the conflict still carries on we can consult a TA or professor.

---

## Accountability

* Each team member will be responsible for their assigned task, and should be accountable for any missed tasks/internal deadline we can allow a 2-3 hour grace period to do it, and team members can always ask for help.
